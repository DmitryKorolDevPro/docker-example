  "description": "A task: Make 2 backend services (in the simplest way), where 1. Service (and only 1) A will be available so that it can be accessed via HTTP (REST-API) 2. Service B should not be accessible from outside 3. Service A, when processing a request from a user, must go to the API to service B, take an answer from him -> \"process\" and give an answer to the user 4. Services must be built via docker-compose 5. For these services, you need to describe the Dockerfile, but it should be 1 and not a separate Dockerfile for each 6. Dockerfile should be optimized for build speed, and produce minimal image size",
